this small project has two index files. index.html has no flex box costumizations and does not support update # of people.
index1.html has some flex box customization and support updating # of people.
the reason of including index.html is to show that modular.js can be instanciting and no unwanted methods are exposed to the client.
the modular.js takes 2 parameters, 1 for the div id of the html file, and 2 to decide if we are to call stats because when I kept it as self calling function, it gives errors when browsing the html file that does not have update # of people feature.
